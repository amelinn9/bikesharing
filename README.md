# NYC CitiBike Analysis

## Overview
After a trip to New York City with my friend, Kate, we noticed that part of what made our trip so great was our use of CitiBike, a bike-share program. This got me wondering if we could start a similar ride-share business in my hometown, Des Moines, Iowa. Making this business work might be quite different in Des Moines than in New York City. So, we gathered information on the bike-share business in New York City and conducted an analysis to better understand how it works. Then, we created a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines. The purpose of this analysis is to help the potential investors determine whether they should invest in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines.

This page shows an overview of the dataset to introduce some of the categories that will be explored in this analysis. Below are some of the key points:

- This Citi Bike Trip Histories dataset was obtained from the [citibike System Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data "Citi Bike Trip Histories") site. We chose to only look at data in August of 2019 because there is likely more traffic during the summer months.
- The total number of rides is 2,344,224.
- There was a total of 794 bike rental stations.
- There were two types of customers recorded (customer and subscriber).
- The gender can be broken down into three categories (male, female, and unknown).
