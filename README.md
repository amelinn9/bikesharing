# NYC CitiBike Analysis

## Overview
After a trip to New York City with my friend, Kate, we noticed that part of what made our trip so great was our use of CitiBike, a bike-share program. This got me wondering if we could start a similar ride-share business in my hometown, Des Moines, Iowa. Making this business work might be quite different in Des Moines than in New York City. So, we gathered information on the bike-share business in New York City and conducted an analysis to better understand how it works. Then, we created a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines. The purpose of this analysis is to help the potential investors determine whether they should invest in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines.
